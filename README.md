# Notesbook_project_EJS

Hi! I'm Caroline and here is my new project - Notes Kepper App!
It was made by using EJS (my first vanilla EJS project ðŸ™ƒ).

I was using only EJS so the project has some bad parts, which can be made better.
Still during the learnig process to become a Frnotend Developer I decide look into some backend programming and EJS was natural choice.
In this project I want to only prove how far can I go using 'vanilla' EJS.

So here we are!
I hoper the project has some good parts too, and I'll probably working on it further learning about data bases.
